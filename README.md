# EOG
EOG is an android app which uses Electrooculography signal to detect alpha brain wave intensity. 
It performs DSP on the signal which is retrieved from a BLE device attached to the skin.

## Introduction
Electrooculography (EOG/E.O.G.) is a technique for measuring the corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front and the back of the human eye. The resulting signal is called the electrooculogram. Primary applications are in ophthalmological diagnosis and in recording eye movements. Unlike the electroretinogram, the EOG does not measure response to individual visual stimuli. --Cited from wikipedia

Alpha waves are neural oscillations in the frequency range of 7.5â€“12.5 Hz[1] arising from synchronous and coherent (in phase or constructive) electrical activity of thalamic pacemaker cells in humans. They are also called Berger's wave in memory of the founder of EEG.

This app is primarily used for experimental purpose to prove the existance of relation between EOG signal and alpha waves.
